# Brain-tumor


https://braintumor-detect-priti.streamlit.app/   - Users upload an image and click "Predict" to classify it using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The model categorizes the image into one of four classes: “No Tumor”, “Glioma Tumor”, “Meningioma Tumor”, or “Pituitary Tumor”. The predicted class and confidence level are displayed, along with additional information on tumor type if detected. This design provides immediate predictions and detailed insights, enhancing user engagement and understanding of diagnosis and treatment options
